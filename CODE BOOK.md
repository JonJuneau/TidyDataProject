# The Measurements were split into different variables
## Activity -- can have six different values, depending upon the activity during the measurements
## Subject -- identifies the subject in the  study
## Domain -- the measurements were either in the time domain or the Fourier Transform placing them in the frequency domain
## Object -- measurements were made on the subject's body and adjusted for gravitational forces
## Instrument -- the measurements were made with either an accelerameter or a gyroscope
## Derivative -- the measurements were made of accelaration and then the jerk was calculated from the time changes in the acceleration
## Dimension -- the measurements were made in three directions (and one summary direction):
### X
### Y
### Z
### Magnitude (a summary of the X, Y, and Z directions)
## Statistic -- the values in the data had several statistics.  For this project, only the mean and standard deviation were analyzed.
